## Submitting Exercises

### Submission Process
1. **Via GitHub**: All exercises submitted through GitHub repositories
2. **Mark as Completed**: Use the ["my submissions" tab](https://submissions.mooc.fi/) to mark exercises as done
3. **Per-Part Submission**: Exercises submitted one part at a time
   - ‚ö†Ô∏è **Finality**: Once submitted for a part, no additional exercises can be added

### Repository Management
| Approach | Recommendation |
|----------|----------------|
| **Single Repository** | Use clear directory naming (e.g., `part0/`, `part1/`) |
| **Multiple Repositories** | Create new repository for each part (recommended) |
| **Private Repositories** | Add `mluukkai` as collaborator |

### Plagiarism Policy
- üîç **Detection System**: Automated checks against:
  - Model answers
  - Peer submissions
- ‚öñÔ∏è **Consequences**: Handled per [University of Helsinki plagiarism policy](https://www.helsinki.fi/en/about-us/quality-assurance-and-audits/plagiarism)
- ‚ùó **Key Requirement**: All work must be original

### Incremental Application Development
For multi-exercise applications:
- **Submission Requirement**: Only final application state needed
- **Commit Strategy**:
  ```git
  # Optional approach (not required)
  git commit -m "Exercise 1.1 completed"
  git commit -m "Exercise 1.2 completed"
