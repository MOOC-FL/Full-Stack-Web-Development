## Taking the course
The course contains fourteen parts, the first of which is numbered 0 for consistency with past iterations. One part corresponds loosely to one week (averaging 15-20 hours) of studying, but the speed of completing the course is flexible.

Proceeding from part n to part n+1 is not sensible before enough know-how of the topics in part n has been achieved. In pedagogic terms, the course uses Mastery Learning, and you are only intended to proceed to the next part after doing enough of the exercises of the previous part.

In parts 1-4 you are expected to do at least all of the exercises that are not marked with an asterisk(*). Exercises marked with an asterisk count towards your final grade, but skipping them does not prevent you from doing the compulsory exercises in the next parts. Parts 5-13 do not have asterisk-marked exercises since there is no similar dependency on previous parts.

The speed of completing the course is flexible.

Exercise completion time statistics can be found via the submission system.
